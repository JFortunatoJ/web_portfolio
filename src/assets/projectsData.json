I decided in mid-2012 that I would turn my passion for games into my profession so I started to study and develop simple projects using Unity Engine. In 2014 I graduated from high school, in 2015 in technical education in computer science, where I had my first solid contact with programming, and in 2016 i started my Digital Games degree at FACENS, graduating in 2018 when I started working as a unity developer. I love learning new things and challenges motivate me, I always try to develop the projects in which I participate in the best possible way, worrying not only about the development but also the management.My name is João Fortunato Jr, I am a game developer and I live in Brazil.
