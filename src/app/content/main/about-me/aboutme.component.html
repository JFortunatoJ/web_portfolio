  <p class="about-me-title">Hey There!</p>
  <p class="about-me-description">
    My name is João Fortunato Jr, I am a game developer and I live in Brazil. I decided in mid-2012 that I would
    turn my passion for games into my profession so
    I started to study and develop simple projects using Unity Engine. In 2014 I graduated from high school, in
    2015 in technical education in computer science, where I
    had my first solid contact with programming, and in 2016 i started my Digital Games degree at FACENS,
    graduating in 2018 when I started working as a unity developer.
    I love learning new things and challenges motivate me, I always try to develop the projects in which I
    participate in the best possible way, worrying not only about the development but also the management.

    Below you can check the projects in which I participated in the development, both professional and personal,
    as well as tutorial videos that I publish on youtube, not only to share knowledge but also as a source of
    learning about new subjects :D
